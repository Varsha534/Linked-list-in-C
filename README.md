# Linked-list-in-C

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

A Linked List is a linear data structure which looks like a chain of nodes, where each node is a different element. Unlike Arrays, Linked List elements are not stored at a contiguous location. It is basically chains of nodes, each node contains information such as data and a pointer to the next node in the chain. In the linked list there is a head pointer, which points to the first element of the linked list, and if the list is empty then it simply points to null or nothing.

- Types of linked lists: 

There are mainly three types of linked lists:

1] Single-linked list
2] Double linked list
3] Circular linked list

- Singly-linked list
A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer. Traversal of items can be done in the forward direction only due to the linking of every node to its next node.
